Steam Games Dataset from Kaggle; Author: Martin Bustos

Standard and UTF-8 files available now (due to some parsing issues).

Both files constitute the whole dataset. 

NOTE: The dataset has been refined, by removing irrelevant columns. The following columns are in this dataset:


Name (Primary Entity),	AppID,	Release date,	Price,	Discount,	Rating Score (Wilson score interval lower bound),	Achievements,	Recommendations,	Supported languages,	Windows,	Mac,	Linux,	Developers,	Publishers,	Categories,	Genres,	Tags
